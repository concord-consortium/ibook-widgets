Some Example iBook widgets

The screen shots were made with a couple of chrome extensions:
- Screen Capture (by Google) - this doesn't handle retina displays correctly so if you have one you need to change your resolution to take the screenshots. I used an external monitor.
- Window Resizer - besides giving some preset sizes, it also shows the size of the viewport as you resize the window.
